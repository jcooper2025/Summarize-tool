# Summarize-tool

My own project for EdX class - How to Use ChatGPT in Tech/Coding/Data.

Started as a project for EdX class. This has changed into a tool I want to use in my own learning.
This will also act as a vehicle to learn vector databases, streamlit and many of the issues around breaking up documents for summarization and storing in a vector database.
